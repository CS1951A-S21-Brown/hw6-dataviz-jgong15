    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
          <h4>1) Answering the questions</h4>
          <p>
            - Graph 1 answers Question 1 by showing the top 10 video games
            in a selected year (using the select element), ordered by global
            sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Graph 2 answers the Question 2 by showing the relative shares of the
            top 10 genres in a selected region (using the select element), with
            a tooltip on hover displaying genre and gross sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Graph 3 answers Question 3 by showing the top 10 publishers in a
            selected genre (using the select element), ordered by global
            sales.
          </p>
          <h4>2) Role of D3</h4>
          <p>
            - One role of D3 is the possiblity of being able to display data in a
            webpage format, rather than in a separate application such as word
            or a PNG.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Another role of D3 is the the ability to customize the type of information
            displayed, especially in comparison to an alternative like excel.
          </p>
          <p>
            - A third role of D3 is the ability to inserte interactive elements
            into data, such as select systems and tooltips on hover.
          </p>
          <h4>3) Why not D3?</h4>
          <p>
            One time D3 is not the best is when visualizing data in a non-web context,
            such as when making a powerpoint presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another time D3 is not the best is when wanting to make a quick chart,
            and a tool like Plotly may be better.
          </p>
          <p>
            A third time D3 is not the best is when you need greater control,
            as a tool like Matplotlib may be more capable.
          </p>
          <h4>4) Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            One accesibility issue is that in my second graph (the Pie Chart)
            one cannot see the information points without hovering over the
            sections of the pie (as is advised against in the gif of
            Amanda Miller's article). This can be cured by adding labels to the
            pie chart indicating the related genre (unfortuately technical
            difficulties prevented this from working).
          </p>
          <p>
            A second accessiblity issue is that my graphs may be difficult
            to read for the colorblind, especially for those with tritanopia in
            the bar graphs.
          </p>
          <h4>5) Missed Opportunities</h4>
          <p>
            I could have added visible information to my pie chart to indicate
            what genre each section represented. What prevented me from doing
            this was time limitations preventing me from fully resolving an
            underlying programming issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could have spent more time making sure that the colors of my bar
            graphs and pie graph were unique and more accessible to the
            colorblind. What prevented me from doing this was primarily time
            limitations. This is, however, partially mitigated by the spaces
            between different parts of graphs.
